<br>Bitdrachma is peer-to-peer electronic cash system that uses Blockchain technology based on Bitcoin to create consensus among the the network. The protocol has an internal currency called bitdrachma DRA (₯) that incentives miners to confirm transactions and help secure the network. Bitdrachma uses a blockchain security system called proof-of-stake to prevent double spending and solve the Greek Generals problem. All the coins were fairly distributed using an asic resistant proof-of-work system with the X11 algorithm.
